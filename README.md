\# Credit Risk Modelling – Loan Classification



This project implements a machine learning model to predict loan approval risk using real-world banking data.



\## Objective

To build and evaluate a binary classification model that helps assess credit risk based on customer and loan-related features.



\## Dataset

\- Source: Banking marketing dataset

\- Total records: ~41,000

\- Target variable: Loan\_Status\_label (0 = No Risk, 1 = Risk)



\## Methodology

\- Data preprocessing and feature scaling

\- Train-test split (80-20)

\- Model training using Random Forest Classifier

\- Handling class imbalance using balanced class weights

\- Model evaluation using accuracy and classification report



\## Results

\- Achieved approximately 88% accuracy on test data

\- Observed class imbalance impact on minority class predictions



\## Tools \& Technologies

\- Python

\- Pandas, NumPy

\- Scikit-learn

\- Jupyter Notebook



\## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow for credit risk modelling and highlights challenges related to imbalanced datasets.
